# Bug Fixes Applied

## Date: September 30, 2025

### Critical Bugs Fixed

#### 1. Duplicate Session Manager Context (CRITICAL)
**File:** `mcp_proxy/__main__.py`
**Issue:** The code had a duplicate `session_manager.run()` context manager that would cause a runtime error. The lifespan context manager was defined but never used, and then `session_manager.run()` was called again later.

**Original Code:**
```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app):
    """Lifespan context for session manager."""
    async with session_manager.run():
        yield

async def app(scope, receive, send):
    ...

async with session_manager.run():  # Duplicate!
    ...
```

**Fixed:** Removed the unused lifespan context manager and kept only the single `session_manager.run()` call.

**Impact:** Would have caused the server to fail at startup or behave unexpectedly.

---

#### 2. Missing Error Handling for LLM API Calls (HIGH)
**File:** `mcp_proxy/server.py`
**Issue:** The `_summarize_output` method called the LLM API without any try-except handling. Any API errors would crash the entire tool call.

**Fixed:** Added try-except block around LLM API call that:
- Catches any exceptions during summarization
- Logs the error with full traceback
- Returns the original output as fallback

**Impact:** API failures (network issues, rate limits, etc.) would crash tool calls instead of gracefully falling back.

---

#### 3. Missing LLM Client Null Check (HIGH)
**File:** `mcp_proxy/server.py`
**Issue:** The `_summarize_output` method would attempt to call `self.llm_client` even if it was None (when `llm_base_url` is not provided).

**Fixed:** Added explicit check for `self.llm_client` existence before attempting summarization:
```python
if not self.llm_client:
    logger.warning("LLM client not configured, returning original output for %s", tool_name)
    return output_str
```

**Impact:** Would cause AttributeError when trying to use the proxy without LLM configuration.

---

#### 4. Unused Import (MINOR)
**File:** `mcp_proxy/__main__.py`
**Issue:** `from contextlib import asynccontextmanager` was imported but never used after fixing bug #1.

**Fixed:** Removed the unused import.

**Impact:** Code cleanliness only.

---

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test without LLM configuration:**
   ```bash
   MCP_UPSTREAM_URL=http://localhost:8931/mcp python -m mcp_proxy
   ```
   Should work without crashes.

2. **Test with invalid LLM URL:**
   Configure an invalid LLM URL and verify graceful fallback when summarization fails.

3. **Test normal operation:**
   Run with full configuration and verify summarization works correctly.
